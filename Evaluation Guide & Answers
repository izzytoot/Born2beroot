## OVERVIEW

1. Check if the file signature.txt is inside the project's repository
  - Clone repository;
  - Inside the repository run < ls >

2. Check if the machine numbers match:
  - Run < cat -e singature.txt >
  - Run < cd /sgoinfre/username/project-folder-name >
  - Run < shasum foldername.vdi >
  - Compare outputs

3. What is a Virtual Machine and how does it work?
  - It's a software that simulates a computer inside another computer;
  - It uses resources of the real machine (host);
  - It allows running different operating systems within one computer;
  - It's good for testing, developing and running isolated environments;
  - Examples of usage: running Linux on a Windows computer; using a different IP for certain operations; testing a created program in different environments; etc.

4. Rocky vs Debian
  - Debian:
      - Recommended for who's learning;
      - Stable and simple;
      - It uses packages apt with .deb files.
  - Rocky:
      - Used more by companies and professional developers;
      - Less user friendly;
      - It uses a packages dng with .rpm files.

5. Why Debian?
  - User friendly, stable and safe.
  - Ideal for who is learning.

6. Apt vs aptitude:
  - Apt:
      - More basic, without visual interface;
      - Direct and simple when adding, removing or updating packages.
  - Aptitude:
      - More advanced and with a visual interface;
      - Allows confict resolution with automatic dependencies.

7. Whant is APPArmour?
  - A system to control access to the Virtual Machine;
  - It establishes rules on what each program is allowed to do within the VM;
  - It avoids malicious behaviours by programs;
  - Creates a safe environment for the VM.

## SIMPLE CONFIGURATION

1. Verify that there isn't a graphic interface;

2. Starting the machine:
  - Open in Virtual Box;
  - Crypt Password (in my case 42Borntoberoot);
  - User login (in my case icunha-t);
  - User Password (in my case it's the 42 password);
  - Verify that we're not on root: run < whoami >;

3. Check Operating System: run < uname -V> ir < hostnamectl >

4. Verify that UFW is launched: run < sudo ufw status >

5. Check SSH status: run < sudo service  shh status >

## USER

1. Check users (evaluated username must be there): run < users >

2. Check user in groups "sudo" and "user42"
